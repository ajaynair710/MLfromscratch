# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these algorithms by implementing them without relying on machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn.

## Implemented Algorithms
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Linear Regression**

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the implementations:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajaynair710/MLfromscratch.git
cd MLfromscratch
```
2. Run the scripts:
```bash
python knn.py
python linear_regression.py
```
